data name format:
1. runoff or osi
2. which basin (short, short + long, med + long) code as: s, sl, sm
3. if osi: what peaks. (short, med, long) code as s,m ,l

e.g.
osi_sl_s.  annual osi file, from basin with short and long peaks. short osi component
runoff_s.  monthly runoff file. from basin with only short peaks


dataframe format:
(1) monthly runoff
100 rows * 1200 columns
100 rows: each row is one simulation
1200 columns: 100year*12 months

(2) annual osi file

100 rows* 100 columns
100 rows (100 year data in one simulation)
100 column: 100 simulations
Each column vector is one simulated timeseries
